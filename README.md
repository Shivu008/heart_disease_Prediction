# ðŸ’“ Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical symptoms and diagnostic features. 
A synthetic dataset of 100,000 patient records is used to simulate real-world data, making it ideal for model training and evaluation.

# Project File
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` â€“ Complete Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and feature analysis.
- `Heart_Disease_Patient_Data.csv` â€“ Synthetic dataset (optional for sharing).
- `heart_disease_model.pkl` â€“ Trained Random Forest model saved using joblib.
- `scaler.pkl` â€“ StandardScaler object used for scaling input features.

# Features
- Synthetic dataset with 100,000 records
- Data preprocessing using encoding and scaling
- Random Forest Classifier used for training
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Feature importance analysis with visualization
- Model saved for future deployment

# Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
